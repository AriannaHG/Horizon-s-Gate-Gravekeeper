# Horizon-s-Gate-Gravekeeper
A class mod that adds the Gravekeeper and its content to Horizon's Gate.


# Delve into a Troubled Tomb

Delve into a troubled tomb to seek ancient secrets and forbidden powers. Do battle with the recently departed and afterwards seek training in a new class; the **Gravekeeper**.

Gravekeepers raise veritable armies of the dead to lay waste to their foes and offer a variety of playstyles, most of which revolve around minions. While Gravekeepers lack the ability to take out foes of their own accord, a Gravekeeper may opt to equip themselves with a new weapon type to shore up this weakness; the **grimoire**.

Grimoires can strike a single target up to 4 tiles away, dealing damage based on your *Ruin* skill. Grimoires may additionally provide supplementary effects.
